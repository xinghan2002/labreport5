# Lab Report 5

## Part 1: How you found the tests with different results?

I used vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop.


## Part 2: Link to two of the test-files with different-results
1. [File 194](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/edit/main/test-files/194.md)
2. [File 201](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/edit/main/test-files/201.md)


## Part 3: For Each Test

### a. Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
1. For file 194, neither of the output is correct;
2. For file 201, our implementation is correct.

### b. Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).
